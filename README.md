# Capstone Project Description

*What problem does your project solve?*

My project is meant to give the average person a way to be compensated for being a social influencer on the internet. It also allows content creators to get paid organic traffic to their content.

Who has this problem?

Content creators on the internet want ways to increase traffic to their content. This platform allows them to create and fund social sharing campaigns that allow them to increase organic traffic to their content.

How will your project solve this problem?

My project will create a direct way for users to be tied to the links they share, and for the traffic the send through their links.

What inputs does it need?

It needs businesses create accounts, and then input URLs, total spending amounts, maximum cost per traffic they want to send.

The user side will need to have user information, and track the links they share, and the total traffic they send through their link.

What outputs does it produce?

It will add points to the users account for traffic they send to links they share. It will also produce insight into how the content creators content is being shared on the web.

What technologies do you plan to use?

I plan on using Angular.js, express, knex, html/css, and some other technology to keep track on the traffic and visitors sent through the content links.
